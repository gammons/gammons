### Hi there!

I'm Grant.  I currently am the head of engineering at [ConvertKit][ck], which enables creators to earn a living online.

Outside of that, I maintain [Ultralist][ul] which is a useful task management sytstem for engineers and other tech-y folks.

I blog at grant.dev, although I don't write as much as I should.
